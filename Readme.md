Electronic chess board are increasingly used to capture competitive (rated) chess games. Most prominent is CGT which also alows tournament arbiter to publish games on the Cloud. 
While CGT's Chess Games viewer is fine web app, at this point in time (2024) it does not allow for easy download of the game moves, and yet a chess player might want to download the game(s) in .pgn (portable game notation) format for analysis or future reference. 

This tool main function is to fetch game(s) from DGT's Live Cloud and save in .pgn format to local user's disk.

![GUI#github](https://github.com/dusan-dakic/chess_prep_tools/blob/main/doc/downloader_v_0_1.png)

Minimum Instructions: 
:one: replace default link shown in :one: link 
:two: click on start download 

Other options:
"Filter by name": if a text is entered here the tournament ganes will be checked for "name" and only if white or black player is partial or full match the game will be downloaded, otherwise it will be skipped.

"Saving to PGN": there are two ways to save games: 
  as a collection of all games within single pgn - one file for all 
  as a one pgn file per game, so a link to tournament will produce number of files, one per each match in tournament 
  
"Output folder": this is the location on your disk where files will be downloaded. At the moment a file with matching name will be overwritten without warning. Default folder is one from which you are running the tool.

#### Collection of already downloaded games:

Some games were already downloaded so you can just grab them from *games* folder, and do not need to download them yourself
