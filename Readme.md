Tool(s) to help with Chess match preparation or study.

 
## :one: Electronic DGT board (recorded) game downloader "dgtfetch". 

Electronic chess board are increasingly used to capture chess games at tournaments. Most prominent is DGT which also alows tournament arbiter to publish games on the LiveChess Cloud. 
While DGT's Chess Games viewer is fine web app, at this point in time (July 2024) it does not allow for easy download of the game moves in pgn format. So a chess player who might want to download the game(s) in .pgn (portable game notation) format for analysis or future reference can manually re-type the game ... fine workaround if just few games are in question. 

So this tool main function is to fetch game(s) from DGT's LiveChess Cloud and save in .pgn format to local user's disk.
Additional functions (to be added later) are:
I. post-processing of the pgn 
  1. process the game and detect issues (e.g. impossible/incorrect moves: rare but few were observed)
  2. detect Chess opening and add to pgn header 
  3. add player FIDE rating if found on FIDE's website  


As hinted above, the motivation for writting this tool was automation of the extraction of the game moves. Notably the DGT board owner (typically tournament organizer) has access to functions to export and publish the games to his own website. However chess player who wants to get game moves, at present has no such option. In June 2024 I have searched with Google for any pre-existing solution for this minor annoyancem but did not find the code or tool thay would be helpful in that respect. 

To illustrate, this is a screenshot of the Webapp User Interface as at 08/Sep/2024 

![Example](https://github.com/dusan-dakic/chess_prep_tools/blob/main/doc/livechesscluod-ui-illustration.png)

UI Elements 
1. LiveChess website address 
2. ID of the tournament aws part of the URL 
3. Tournament title 
4. Game players info 
5. DGT info for Round and DGT board 
6. Time on chess clock at the position shown on the browser canvas 
7. Game moves in scrolable panel 
8. Game result, if completed 
9. User interface controls to go to the start/end of the game; previous/next move; previous/next board; flip board; expand to full screen


Recently a new type of WebApp appeared at 'Best in the West 2024'  tournament and it also does not allow easy way to get game in pgn format, and provides Stockfish game evaluation ... see: https://live.hobsonsbaychess.com/tournament/bitw2024

- additional Python components: requirements.txt

```
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To run executable on Windows, Linux

Work in progress ... I'm not keen on bying certificate just to build Exe for Windows*, testing pyinstaller approach.
It appeaqrs that Windows OS classifies everything as malware, so that is annoying.

![GUI#github](https://github.com/dusan-dakic/chess_prep_tools/blob/main/doc/downloader_v_0_1.png)

Minimum Instructions: 

:one:   replace default link shown in :one: link 
:two:   click on start download 

Other options:
"Filter by name": if a text is entered here the tournament ganes will be checked for "name" and only if white or black player is partial or full match the game will be downloaded, otherwise it will be skipped.

"Saving to PGN": there are two ways to save games: 
  as a collection of all games within single pgn - one file for all 
  as a one pgn file per game, so a link to tournament will produce number of files, one per each match in tournament 
  
"Output folder": this is the location on your disk where files will be downloaded. At the moment a file with matching name will be overwritten without warning. Default folder is one from which you are running the tool.

#### Collection of already downloaded games:

Some games were already downloaded so you can just grab them from *games* folder, and do not need to download them yourself
