Minimum Instructions:

:two:   click on start download 

Other options:
"Filter by name": if a text is entered here the tournament ganes will be checked for "name" and only if white or black player is partial or full match the game will be downloaded, otherwise it will be skipped.

"Saving to PGN": there are two ways to save games: 
  as a collection of all games within single pgn - one file for all 
  as a one pgn file per game, so a link to tournament will produce number of files, one per each match in tournament 
  
"Output folder": this is the location on your disk where files will be downloaded. At the moment a file with matching name will be overwritten without warning. Default folder is one from which you are running the tool.

#### Collection of already downloaded games:

Some games were already downloaded so you can just grab them from *games* folder, and do not need to download them yourself
